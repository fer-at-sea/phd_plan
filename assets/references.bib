	abstract = {Long-term studies are necessary to establish trends and to understand seagrasses' spatial and temporal dynamic. Nevertheless, this type of research is scarce, as the required databases are often unavailable. The objectives of this study are to create a method for mapping the seagrass Zostera noltei using remote sensing techniques, and to apply it to the characterization of the meadows' extension trend and the potential drivers of change. A time series was created using a novel method based on remote sensing techniques that proved to be adequate for mapping the seagrass in the emerged intertidal. The meadows seem to have a decreasing trend between 1984 and the early 2000s, followed by an increasing tendency that represents a recovery in the extension area of the species. This 30-year analysis demonstrated the Z. noltei's recovery in the study site, similar to that in other estuaries nearby and contrary to the worldwide decreasing behavior of seagrasses.},

	abstract = {Accurate habitat mapping methods are urgently required for the monitoring, conservation, and management of blue carbon ecosystems and their associated services. This study focuses on exposed intertidal seagrass meadows, which play a major role in the functioning of nearshore ecosystems. Using Sentinel-2 (S2) data, we demonstrate that satellite remote sensing can be used to map seagrass percent cover (SPC) and leaf biomass (SB), and to characterize its seasonal dynamics. In situ radiometric and biological data were acquired from three intertidal meadows of Zostera noltei along the European Atlantic coast in the summers of 2018 and 2019. This information allowed algorithms to estimate SPC and SB from a vegetation index to be developed and assessed. Importantly, a single SPC algorithm could consistently be used to study Z. noltei-dominated meadows at several sites along the European Atlantic coast. To analyze the seagrass seasonal cycle and to select images corresponding to its maximal development, a two-year S2 dataset was acquired for a French study site in Bourgneuf Bay. The po­ tential of S2 to characterize the Z. noltei seasonal cycle was demonstrated for exposed intertidal meadows. The SPC map that best represented seagrass growth annual maximum was validated using in situ measurements, resulting in a root mean square difference of 14\%. The SPC and SB maps displayed a patchy distribution, in­ fluenced by emersion time, mudflat topology, and seagrass growth pattern. The ability of S2 to measure the surface area of different classes of seagrass cover was investigated, and surface metrics based on seagrass areas with SPC ≥ 50\% and SPC ≥ 80\% were computed to estimate the interannual variation in the areal extent of the meadow. Due to the high spatial resolution (pixel size of 10 m), frequent revisit time (≤ 5 days), and long-term objective of the S2 mission, S2-derived seagrass time-series are expected to contribute to current coastal eco­ system management, such as the European Water Framework Directive, but to also guide future adaptation plans to face global change in coastal areas. Finally, recommendations for future intertidal seagrass studies are pro­ posed.},

The large size, spatial complexity, and interannual variability of seagrass ecosystems significantly challenge field monitoring. In this study, a multi-mission satellite time-series was used to estimate long-term changes in seagrass status in a macrotidal system dominated by Zostera noltei, at Bourgneuf Bay (French Atlantic coast). Metrics of seagrass extent and density were obtained from Earth Observation (EO) using vali­ dated and inter-calibrated Landsat, SPOT and Sentinel2 data from 1985 to 2020. The information provided by satellite data made it possible to compute and compare several seagrass indicators currently in use in several European countries (France, Portugal and UK) within the WFD. Both the seagrass extent and meadow-averaged density displayed increasing trends since 1985. A time-series of merged observations from various satellites revealed a high degree of interannual variability in seagrass extent, with abrupt losses (up to 50\% within one year) alternating with periods of slow recovery (typically 4–6 years). The seagrass meadow which was in a moderate status (sensu the WFD) in the 1980s, achieved an overall recurrent good or high status since the mid1990s. Altogether, the methods and results presented here demonstrated that EO is a reliable source of infor­ mation for mapping and assessing the status of intertidal seagrass, complementing in situ measurements by providing long-term, spatial view and standardized observation framework. We recommend the systematic use of EO time-series in complement to traditional field measurements in seagrass monitoring programs such as the WFD.},

However, this type of interaction has been rarely investigated over the long term and at the scale of the whole seagrass habitat. In this work, reciprocal links between an intertidal seagrass species, Zostera noltei, and a herbivorous bird feeding on this seagrass species, the migratory goose Branta bernicla bernicla, were investigated using an original combination of long-term Earth Observation (EO) and bird census data. Seagrass Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs) such as seagrass abundance and phenology were measured from 1985 to 2020 using high-resolution satellite remote sensing over Bourgneuf Bay (France), and cross-analysed with in situ measurements of bird population size during the goose wintering season. Our results showed a mutual relationship between seagrass and Brent geese over the four last decades, suggesting that the relationship between the two species extends beyond a simple grass—herbivore consumptive effect. We provided evidence of two types of interactions: (i) a bottom-up control where the latesummer seagrass abundance drives the wintering population of herbivorous geese and (ii) an indirect top-down effect of Brent goose on seagrass habitat, where seagrass development is positively inﬂuenced by the bird population during the previous wintering season. Such a mutualistic relationship has strong implications for biodiversity conservation because protecting one species is beneﬁcial to the other one, as demonstrated here by the positive trajectories observed from 1985 to 2020 in both seagrass and bird populations. Importantly, we also demonstrated here that exploring the synergy between EO and in situ bird data can beneﬁt seagrass ecology and ecosystem management.},

	abstract = {Monitoring biodiversity and how anthropogenic pressures impact this is critical, especially as anthropogenically driven climate change continues to affect all ecosystems. Intertidal areas are exposed to particularly high levels of pressures owing to increased population density in coastal areas. Traditional methods of monitoring intertidal areas do not provide datasets with full coverage in a cost-effective or timely manner, and so the use of remote sensing to monitor these areas is becoming more common. Monitoring of ecologically important monospecific habitats, such as seagrass beds, using remote sensing techniques is well documented. However, the ability for multispectral data to distinguish efficiently and accurately between classes of vegetation with similar pigment composition, such as seagrass and green algae, has proved difficult, often requiring hyperspectral data. A ma­ chine learning approach was used to differentiate between soft-bottom intertidal vegetation classes when exposed at low tide, comparing 6 different multi- and hyperspectral remote and in situ sensors. For the library of 366 spectra, collected across Northern Europe, high accuracy ({\textgreater}80\%) was found across all spectral resolutions. While a higher spectral resolution resulted in higher accuracy, there was no discernible increase in accuracy above 10 spectral bands (95\%: Sentinel-2 MSI sensor with a spatial resolution of 20 m). This work highlights the ability of multispectral sensors to discriminate intertidal vegetation types, while also showing the most important wavelengths for this discrimination ({\textasciitilde}530 and {\textasciitilde} 730 nm), giving recommendations for spectral ranges of future satellite missions. The ability for multispectral sensors to aid in accurate and rapid intertidal vegetation classi­ fication at the taxonomic resolution of classes, could be a significant contribution for future sustainable and effective ecosystem management.},

            Seagrasses are marine flowering plants that form extensive meadows from the inter-tidal zone up to {\textasciitilde}50 m depth. As biological and ecological Essential Biodiversity Variables, seagrass cover and composition provide a wide range of ecosystem services. Inter-tidal seagrass meadows provide services to many ecosystems, so monitoring their occurrence, extent, condition and diversity can be used to indicate the biodiversity and health of local ecosystems. Current global estimates of seagrass extent and recent reviews either do not mention inter-tidal seagrasses and their seasonal variation, or combine them with sub-tidal seagrasses. Here, using high-spatial and high-temporal resolution satellite data (Sentinel-2), we demonstrate a method for consistently mapping inter-tidal seagrass meadows and their phenology at a continental scale. We were able to highlight varying seasonal patterns that are observable across a 23° latitudinal range. Timings of peaks in seagrass extent varied by up to 5 months, rather than the previously assumed marginal to non-existent variation in peak timing. These results will aid management by providing high-resolution spatio-temporal monitoring data to better inform seagrass conservation and restoration. They also highlight the high level of seasonal variability in inter-tidal seagrass, meaning combination with sub-tidal seagrass for global assessments will likely produce misleading or incorrect estimates.},

	abstract = {Intertidal areas, which emerge during low tide, form a vital link between terrestrial and marine environments. Seagrasses, a well-studied intertidal habitat, provide a multitude of different ecosystem goods and services. However, owing to their relatively high exposure to anthropogenic impacts, seagrasss meadows and other intertidal habitats have seen extensive declines. Remote sensing methods that can capture the spatial and temporal variation of marine habitats are essential to best assess the trajectories of seagrass ecosystems. An advanced machine learning method has been developed to map intertidal vegetation from satellite-derived surface reflectance at a 12-band multispectral resolution and distinguish between similarly pigmented intertidal macrophytes, such as seagrass and green algae. The Intertidal Classification of Europe: Categorising Reflectance of Emerged Areas of Marine vegetation with Sentinel-2 (ICE CREAMS v1.0), a neural network model trained on over 300,000 Sentinel-2 pixels to identify different intertidal habitats, was applied to the open-access long term archive of systematically collected Sentinel-2 imagery to provide 7 years (2017–2023) worth of intertidal seagrass dynamics in 6 sites across Western Europe (471 Sentinel-2 Images). A combination of independently collected visually inspected Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle imagery and in situ quadrat images were used to validate ICE CREAMS. Having achieved a high seagrass classification accuracy (0.82 over 12,000 pixels) and consistent conversion into cover (19\% RMSD), the ICE CREAMS model outputs provided evidence of site specific variation in trajectories of seagrass extent, when appropriate consideration of intra-annual variation has been considered. Inter-annual dynamics of sites showed some instances of consistent change, some indicated stability, while others indicated instability over time, characterised by increases and decreases across the time-series in seagrass coverage. This methological pipeline has helped to create up-to-date monitoring data that, with the planned continuation of the Sentinel missions, will allow almost real-time monitoring of these habitats into the future. This process, and the data it provides, could aid management practitioners from regional to international levels, with the ability to monitor intertidal seagrass meadows at both high spatial and temporal resolution, over continental scales. The implementation of Earth Observation for high-resolution monitoring of intertidal seagrasses could therefore allow for gap-filling seagrass datasets, and sustain specific and rapid management measures.},

	abstract = {Coastal areas support seagrass meadows, which offer crucial ecosystem services, including erosion control and carbon sequestration. However, these areas are increasingly impacted by human activities, leading to habitat fragmentation and seagrass decline. In situ surveys, traditionally performed to monitor these ecosystems, face limitations on temporal and spatial coverage, particularly in intertidal zones, prompting the addition of satellite data within monitoring programs. Yet, satellite remote sensing can be limited by too coarse spatial and/or spectral resolutions, making it difficult to discriminate seagrass from other macrophytes in highly heterogeneous meadows. Drone (unmanned aerial vehicle—UAV) images at a very high spatial resolution offer a promising solution to address challenges related to spatial heterogeneity and the intrapixel mixture. This study focuses on using drone acquisitions with a ten spectral band sensor similar to that onboard Sentinel-2 for mapping intertidal macrophytes at low tide (i.e., during a period of emersion) and effectively discriminating between seagrass and green macroalgae. Nine drone flights were conducted at two different altitudes (12 m and 120 m) across heterogeneous intertidal European habitats in France and Portugal, providing multispectral reflectance observation at very high spatial resolution (8 mm and 80 mm, respectively). Taking advantage of their extremely high spatial resolution, the low altitude flights were used to train a Neural Network classifier to discriminate five taxonomic classes of intertidal vegetation: Magnoliopsida (Seagrass), Chlorophyceae (Green macroalgae), Phaeophyceae (Brown algae), Rhodophyceae (Red macroalgae), and benthic Bacillariophyceae (Benthic diatoms), and validated using concomitant field measurements. Classification of drone imagery resulted in an overall accuracy of 94\% across all sites and images, covering a total area of 467,000 m2. The model exhibited an accuracy of 96.4\% in identifying seagrass. In particular, seagrass and green algae can be discriminated. The very high spatial resolution of the drone data made it possible to assess the influence of spatial resolution on the classification outputs, showing a limited loss in seagrass detection up to about 10 m. Altogether, our findings suggest that the MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) onboard Sentinel-2 offers a relevant trade-off between its spatial and spectral resolution, thus offering promising perspectives for satellite remote sensing of intertidal biodiversity over larger scales.},

	abstract = {Seagrass meadows directly and indirectly provide a wide range of ecosystem services, but their close proximity to anthropogenic activities renders them highly vulnerable. Regardless of their vulnerability and importance as ecosystem health indicators, intertidal seagrasses, unlike their subtidal relatives, have yet to be assessed at continental scales, and current global estimates of seagrass extent either do not mention intertidal seagrasses or combine them with subtidal seagrasses. Here, we present a first of its kind map of intertidal seagrasses in Europe using a harmonised methodology. Over a total intertidal area of 15,100 km2, we found that seagrasses cover an area comparable to the combined areas of Paris and Lisbon: 212 ± 18.8 km2. The proportion of available intertidal area covered by seagrass decreased towards higher latitudes (from {\textasciitilde}5.4 \% at 35◦N to {\textasciitilde}0 \% at 58◦N). Regardless of this pattern, the top three hotspots of seagrass covered the full latitudinal range of Europe, notably in the North Frisian Wadden Sea (Germany), Arcachon Bay (France) and Ria Formosa (Portugal). Furthermore, we showed latitudinal gradients in seagrass cover, with higher cover in low latitudes and lower cover in high latitudes. Finally, an almost linear change in intertidal seagrass peak timing (day of the year of maximum seagrass cover) with latitude was found, with peak timing later the further south. This is a ‘Call-to-Action’ for data that are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR). We present critical data for prioritising and developing policies, management and protection mechanisms across local, regional or international scales to safeguard these important ecosystems and the societies that depend upon them.},

	abstract = {Posidonia oceanica is the dominant seagrass in the Mediterranean Sea that affects biological, biogeochemical and physical processes in Mediterranean coastal areas. The widespread loss of this species is attributed to excessive anthropic pressure and other large-scale environmental changes. Seagrass conservation requires mapping to estimate the extent of existing stocks and to measure changes over time. Optical remote sensing provides a cost-effective method to monitor vast areas of shallow waters that are potential P. oceanica habitat. As part of an interdisciplinary research effort, where the effects of these seagrasses on the hydrodynamics were investigated, new technologies of reliable, fast and effective monitoring of P. oceanica were essential. This paper presents a method for using IKONOS multispectral imagery for bottom classification in a shallow coastal area of Mallorca (Balearic Islands). After applying a supervised classification, pixels are automatically classified in four classes: sand, rock, P. oceanica bottoms and unclassifiable pixels. Results indicate that, in these clear waters, the spectral response of P. oceanica can be determined to a depth of about 15 m. In order to validate the method, the image classification is compared with a bottom classification derived from an acoustical survey. Agreement with the reference acoustic seabed classification is up to 84\% for the sampled area. Spectral IKONOS image analysis is presented as an effective approach for monitoring P. oceanica meadows in most clear, shallow waters of the western Mediterranean.},

	abstract = {Mediterranean seagrasses have been hailed for their numerous ecosystem services, yet they are undergoing a decline in their coverage. The major complication with resolving this tendency is the sparsity of data on their overall distribution. This study addresses the suitability of the recently launched Sentinel-2 satellite for mapping the distribution of Mediterranean seagrass meadows. A comprehensive methodology is presented which applies atmospheric and analytical water column corrections and compares the performance of three diﬀerent supervised classiﬁers. Remote sensing of the Thermaikos Gulf, northwestern Aegean Sea (Greece, eastern Mediterranean Sea) reveals that the utilization of Support Vector Machines on water column corrected reﬂectances yields best accuracies. Two Mediterranean seagrasses, Posidonia oceanica and Cymodocea nodosa, cover a total submerged area of 1.48 km2 between depths of 1.4–16.5 m. With its 10-m spatial resolution and 5-day revisit frequency, Sentinel-2 imagery can mitigate the Mediterranean seagrass distribution data gap and allow better management and conservation in the future in a retrospective, time- and cost-eﬀective fashion.},

	abstract = {Coastal habitats provide a plethora of ecosystem services, yet they undergo continuous pressure and degradation due to the human-induced climate change. Conservation and management imply continuous monitoring and mapping of their spatial distribution at first. The present study explores the capabilities of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission and the contribution of its coastal aerosol band 1 (443 nm) for the mapping of the dominant Mediterranean coastal marine habitats and the bathymetry in three survey sites in the East Mediterranean. The selected sites have shallow to deep habitats and a high variability of oceanographic and seabed morphological conditions. The major findings of our study demonstrate the advantages of the downscaled Sentinel-2 coastal aerosol band 1 for both optically shallow habitat and satellite-derived bathymetry mapping due to its great water penetration. The use of Sentinel-2 band 1 allows detection of Posidonia oceanica seagrass beds down to 32.2 m of depth. Sentinel-2 constellation with its 10-m spatial resolution at most of the spectral bands, 5-day revisit frequency and open data policy can be an important tool to provide crucial missing information on the spatial distribution of coastal habitats and on their bathymetry distribution, especially in data-poor and/or remote areas with large gaps in a retrospective, rapid and non-intrusive manner. As such, it becomes a crucial ally for the conservation and management of coastal habitats globally.},

	abstract = {The seagrass Posidonia oceanica is the main habitat-forming species of the coastal Mediterranean, providing millennial-scale ecosystem services including habitat provisioning, biodiversity maintenance, food security, coastal protection, and carbon sequestration. Meadows of this endemic seagrass species represent the largest carbon storage among seagrasses around the world, largely contributing to global blue carbon stocks. Yet, the slow growth of this temperate species and the extreme projected temperature and sea-level rise due to climate change increase the risk of reduction and loss of these services. Currently, there are knowledge gaps in its basin-wide spatially explicit extent and relevant accounting, therefore accurate and efficient mapping of its distribution and trajectories of change is needed. Here, we leveraged contemporary advances in Earth Observation—cloud computing, open satellite data, and machine learning—with field observations through a cloud-native geoprocessing framework to account the spatially explicit ecosystem extent of P. oceanica seagrass across its full bioregional scale. Employing 279,186 Sentinel-2 satellite images between 2015 and 2019, and a human-labeled training dataset of 62,928 pixels, we mapped 19,020 km2 of P. oceanica meadows up to 25 m of depth in 22 Mediterranean countries, across a total seabed area of 56,783 km2. Using 2,480 independent, field-based points, we observe an overall accuracy of 72\%. We include and discuss global and region-specific seagrass blue carbon stocks using our bioregional seagrass extent estimate. As reference data collections, remote sensing technology and biophysical modelling improve and coalesce, such spatial ecosystem extent accounts could further support physical and monetary accounting of seagrass condition and ecosystem services, like blue carbon and coastal biodiversity. We envisage that effective policy uptake of these holistic seagrass accounts in national climate strategies and financing could accelerate transparent natural climate solutions and coastal resilience, far beyond the physical location of seagrass beds.},

	abstract = {The scientiﬁc method has been characterized as having two distinct components, Discovery and Justiﬁcation. Discovery emphasizes ideas and creativity, focuses on conceiving hypotheses and constructing models, and is generally regarded as lacking a formal logic. Justiﬁcation begins with the hypotheses and models and ends with a valid scientiﬁc inference. Unlike Discovery, Justiﬁcation has a formal logic whose rules must be rigorously followed to produce valid scientiﬁc inferences. In particular, when inferences are based on sample data, the rules of the logic of Justiﬁcation require assessments of bias and precision. Thus, satellite imagebased maps that lack such assessments for parameters of populations depicted by the maps may be of little utility for scientiﬁc inference; essentially, they may be just pretty pictures. Probability- and model-based approaches are explained, illustrated, and compared for producing inferences for population parameters using a map depicting three land cover classes: non-forest, coniferous forest, and deciduous forest. The maps were constructed using forest inventory data and Landsat imagery. Although a multinomial logistic regression model was used to classify the imagery, the methods for assessing bias and precision can be used with any classiﬁcation method. For probability-based approaches, the difference estimator was used, and for modelbased inference, a bootstrap approach was used.},

	abstract = {The production of thematic maps, such as those depicting land cover, using an image classification is one of the most common applications of remote sensing. Considerable research has been directed at the various components of the mapping process, including the assessment of accuracy. This paper briefly reviews the background and methods of classification accuracy assessment that are commonly used and recommended in the research literature. It is, however, evident that the research community does not universally adopt the approaches that are often recommended to it, perhaps a reflection of the problems associated with accuracy assessment, and typically fails to achieve the accuracy targets commonly specified. The community often tends to use, unquestioningly, techniques based on the confusion matrix for which the correct application and interpretation requires the satisfaction of often untenable assumptions (e.g., perfect coregistration of data sets) and the provision of rarely conveyed information (e.g., sampling design for ground data acquisition). Eight broad problem areas that currently limit the ability to appropriately assess, document, and use the accuracy of thematic maps derived from remote sensing are explored. The implications of these problems are that it is unlikely that a single standardized method of accuracy assessment and reporting can be identified, but some possible directions for future research that may facilitate accuracy assessment are highlighted.

	abstract = {The remote sensing science and application communities have developed increasingly reliable, consistent, and robust approaches for capturing land dynamics to meet a range of information needs. Statistically robust and transparent approaches for assessing accuracy and estimating area of change are critical to ensure the integrity of land change information. We provide practitioners with a set of “good practice” recommendations for designing and implementing an accuracy assessment of a change map and estimating area based on the reference sample data. The good practice recommendations address the three major components: sampling design, response design and analysis. The primary good practice recommendations for assessing accuracy and estimating area are: (i) implement a probability sampling design that is chosen to achieve the priority objectives of accuracy and area estimation while also satisfying practical constraints such as cost and available sources of reference data; (ii) implement a response design protocol that is based on reference data sources that provide sufﬁcient spatial and temporal representation to accurately label each unit in the sample (i.e., the “reference classiﬁcation” will be considerably more accurate than the map classiﬁcation being evaluated); (iii) implement an analysis that is consistent with the sampling design and response design protocols; (iv) summarize the accuracy assessment by reporting the estimated error matrix in terms of proportion of area and estimates of overall accuracy, user's accuracy (or commission error), and producer's accuracy (or omission error); (v) estimate area of classes (e.g., types of change such as wetland loss or types of persistence such as stable forest) based on the reference classiﬁcation of the sample units; (vi) quantify uncertainty by reporting conﬁdence intervals for accuracy and area parameters; (vii) evaluate variability and potential error in the reference classiﬁcation; and (viii) document deviations from good practice that may substantially affect the results. An example application is provided to illustrate the recommended process.},
